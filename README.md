# Public Education Salary Analysis
___
### Description

In this series of notebooks I explore publicly available data on public education salaries with a specific goal of investigating the salary differences between administrators and teachers, both in terms of what these salary differences are and how they're caused.

It's also an excellent opportunity for me to develop practical experience with Python and its array of analytics and visualization packages, as well as practice skills in R and analytics.

My data for this project are so far in two parts:

* **2015_2016_PA_Salaries.csv**

 These are the 2015-2016 Pennsylvania salaries for persons in public education. It was sourced from [The York Daily Record](https://www.ydr.com/story/news/watchdog/2017/08/24/teacher-salary-database-2016-17-how-much-pennsylvania-educators-get-paid/594170001/), which prints in an easily copied format, but is updated every year and is currently only displaying 2016-2017. Alternatively, [openPAgov.org](openPAgov.org) provides all this same information for corroboration.


 * **2015_2016_OH_Salaries.csv**

 These are the 2015-2016 Ohio salaries for persons in public education. It was sourced from the Office of the Ohio Treasurer as part of their [Teacher Transparency Project](http://www.tos.ohio.gov/Transparency_Teacher.aspx).
